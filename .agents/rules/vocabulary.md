# 📖 SIMRS Vocabulary & Business Definitions

Always strictly adhere to these definitions when discussing features, writing code, or naming variables to ensure ubiquitous language across the project.

## 📦 Inventory & Materials

- **Material (Bahan Baku)**: Raw ingredients purchased from suppliers. Materials are **NOT** sold directly to customers. Examples: "Kopi Biji Roasted", "Gula Pasir", "Susu Segar".
- **UOM (Unit of Measurement)**: The unit used to measure a material (e.g., Kg, Gram, Liter, Cup).
- **Base Unit**: The smallest/primary unit used for deducting stock in recipes. All other UOMs must convert to this Base Unit. (e.g., Stock is 1000 Grams, not 1 Kg).
- **Inventory**: The actual stock tracking table, separated by branch.

## 🍔 Products & Menus

- **Product (Barang Jualan / Menu)**: The final item displayed on the POS and sold to customers. Examples: "Kopi Susu Gula Aren", "Nasi Goreng Spesial".
- **Variant (Varian)**: Options for a specific product, usually affecting price or SKU (e.g., "Regular", "Large", "Hot", "Ice"). Every product **MUST** have at least 1 variant.
- **Category**: Grouping for Products (e.g., "Main Course", "Beverages").

## 🍳 Production & Recipes

- **Recipe / BOM (Bill of Materials)**: The exact formula of Materials needed to produce 1 Product Variant. When a Variant is sold, the inventory is deducted based on this Recipe using the Base Unit.
- **COGS (HPP - Harga Pokok Penjualan)**: The cost associated with producing a product.
  - **Live/Estimated COGS**: Calculated dynamically as `(Recipe Qty * Material base_cost) + Variant overhead_cost`.
  - **Manual Override**: User-defined `subtotal_cost` in a recipe line that takes precedence over systemic calculation.
- **Overhead Cost**: Standard additional cost per variant (e.g., packaging, waste buffer) defined in `product_variants`.

## 🏢 Multi-Tenancy & Structure

- **Tenant / Branch (Toko/Cabang)**: The operational unit. Almost all transactions, inventory, and product availability are filtered per Branch (`branch_id`).
- **Branch_Products**: A pivot table determining which Products are available to be sold in which Branch.

## 💳 Transactions (Future)

- **Order (Pesanan)**: A completed or ongoing transaction on the POS.
- **Void**: Cancellation of an order or item, which must trigger an audit log and inventory rollback.
